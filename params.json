{"name":"Hamlet","body":"This is a Java package aimed at providing a general means of creating\r\nsimulators for models in theoretical population genetics.  Specifically, it is\r\naimed at modelling the stochastic dynamics of structured populations.\r\n\r\nHamlet can be used in one of two ways.  Firstly, the package can be imported\r\ninto a Java project and used to easily assemble a simulation using a very\r\nsmall amount of code.  This is the most versitile option.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the package can be used in conjunction with the phylogenetic inference\r\nsoftware [BEAST](http://code.google.com/p/beast2/) to specify birth-death\r\nmodel simulations via that system's XML format. This is the most user-friendly\r\noption.\r\n","tagline":"A simulator for birth-death population genetics models.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
