Hamlet
======

This is a Java package aimed at providing a general means of
creating simulators for models in theoretical population
genetics.  Specifically, it is aimed at modelling the
stochastic dynamics of structured populations.

Hamlet can be used in one of two ways.  Firstly, the package
can be imported into a Java project and used to easily
assemble a simulation using a very small amount of code.
This is the most versatile option.

Secondly, the package can be used in conjunction
with the phylogenetic inference software
[BEAST](http://code.google.com/p/beast2/)
to specify birth-death model simulations via that system's
XML format.  This is the most user-friendly option.

Work on this project is made possible by generous funding
from the [Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and
Epidemiology](http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/).
