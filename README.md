Hamlet
======

This is a Java package aimed at providing a general means of creating
simulators for models in theoretical population genetics.  Specifically, it is
aimed at modelling the stochastic dynamics of structured populations.

Hamlet can be used in one of two ways.  Firstly, the package can be imported
into a Java project and used to easily assemble a simulation using a very
small amount of code.  This is the most versitile option.

Secondly, the package can be used in conjunction with the phylogenetic inference
software [BEAST](http://code.google.com/p/beast2/) to specify birth-death
model simulatoins via that system's XML format. This is the most user-friendly
option.
