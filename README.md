MASTER: Moments And Stochastic Trees from Event Reactions
=========================================================

This software aims to provide a general means of creating simulators
for studying the stochastic dynamics of structured populations.
Additionally, it is capable of generating trees representing
inheritance relationships amongst individuals in those populations.
