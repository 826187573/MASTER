MASTER: Moments And Stochastic Trees from Event Reactions
=========================================================

This software aims to provide a general means of creating simulators
for studying the stochastic dynamics of structured populations.
Additionally, it is capable of generating trees representing
inheritance relationships amongst individuals in those populations.

For further information and extensive documentation, please refer to
