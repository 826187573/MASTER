This software aims to provide a general means of creating simulators
for studying the stochastic dynamics of structured populations.
Additionally, it is capable of generating trees representing
inheritance relationships amongst individuals in those populations.

For further information and extensive documentation, please refer to
the MASTER [web page](http://compevol.github.io/MASTER).

This software is free (as in freedom).  With the exception of the
libraries on which it depends, it is made available under the terms of
the GNU General Public Licence version 3, which is contained in this
directory in the file named COPYING.

The following software is currently bundled with MASTER:

* Beast 2 (http://www.beast2.org)
* Google Guava (http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/)
* Jackson (http://jackson.codehaus.org/)
* ANTLR (http://www.antlr.org/)

That software is distributed under the licences provided in the
LICENCE.* files included in this archive.

Work on this project is made possible by generous funding from the
[Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and
Evolution](http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/).
