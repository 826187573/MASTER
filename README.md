MASTER: Moments And Stochastic Trees from Event Reactions
=========================================================

This software aims to provide a general means of creating simulators
for models in theoretical population genetics.  Specifically, it is
designed for modelling the stochastic dynamics of structured
populationas.  Additionally, it is capable of generating trees
representing inheritance relationships amongst individuals in those
populations.

MASTER can be used in one of two ways.  Firstly, the package can be
imported into a Java project and used to easily assemble a simulation
using a very small amount of code.  This is the most versatile option.

Secondly, the package can be used in conjunction with the phylogenetic
inference software [BEAST](http://code.google.com/p/beast2/) to
specify birth-death model simulations via that system's XML format.
This is the most user-friendly option.

Work on this project is made possible by generous funding from the
[Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and
Epidemiology](http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/).
